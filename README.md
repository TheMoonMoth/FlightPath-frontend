## Your Science Fiction Destination

Created as my capstone project at Galvanize Denver, this challenge brought all of my passions together. At its core, Space Lane is a Content Managment System. The developing tools set will help the editor organize submissions and currate the best content. More than that, this is an opportunity for creators of science fiction art to exhibit their work. By using Stripe.js, users can donate directly to authors and artists to show their appreciation for their work. Visit at [SpaceLane.org](https://www.spacelane.org) or continue to browse the repo for a code synopsis. 

## Developers

If you'd like to hack at this code yourself, please fork and clone this repo. Once installed, run that `npm install` command in your terminal and Node will grab all of the dependancies for you.

The app is built with Vue and uses VueX.
Document cload hosting on AWS S3.

## More to come.

This project was intended to challenge my abilities to pick up new technologies in a two week period. As the deadline nears, I'm really starting to get a handle on the tech. So the future will see more organizational tools for the Editor section as well as authentication for editor privledges and bringing more content together. 

## Call For Submission

This project is officially launching May 2018 and we need your contributions to make it happen. Please, submit your science fiction inspired stories, poems, and artistic creations to [SpaceLane.org](https://spacelane.org/).
The deadline for submission is April 30th. Selected work will be eligable for user contributions and will be featured in the first ever issue of Space Lane.
